The system provides a secure and accessible platform for Nigerian citizens to vote in elections, reducing the risk of election fraud and ensuring that their vote counts.

This project was developed as part of the final project at ALX_Africa in conjunction with Holberton school in partial completion of a degree in Fullstack Software Engineering.
